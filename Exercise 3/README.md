## Exercise description
### Work All Day
Michael is a lumberjack, and a pretty OK one at that. However, automation
is making fast (if polite) inroads to his business, and he needs to stay ahead to
remain competitive.
To this end, he has invented a machine called the Flannelmaster GTX. This is
a fearsome tree-cutting contraption, powered by logarithms, which swings an
axe horizontally from a specified height above the ground. Each impact of its
electronic axe cuts the tree cleanly into two parts, the stump rolling away and
the remainder of the tree falling down into the same place.
This continues until the remaining height is too small to cut any more, at which
point any irregular-sized stump is discarded as waste and the remaining lumber
of the same length as the setting is neatly packaged and sold on automatically.
What setting should Michael use for the height in order to minimise loss?

####Input
• One line containing the integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10), the number of settings;
• One line containing N distinct integers Hi (1 ≤ H ≤ 500), the possible settings;
• One line containing the integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 3000), the height of the tree.

####Output
Output the best setting to use so that tree waste will be minimal. If there are multiple settings that yield
equally small waste, you may print any one of them.
